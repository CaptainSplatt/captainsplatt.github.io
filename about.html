        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>Splat Interactive is a group of three people who like to make games</p>
        <p>You can find our list of games <a href="./games.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>We started in 2023 with the idea of Voxel Arts, a VR Minecraft-like adventure game with deep lore.</p>
        <p>Later, we decided to put the project on hold because we don't know how to make a vr game yet so here's a really sad face to take up space</p>
        <img src="./images/sad.jpg" class="center" style="width: 20%" />
        <p>Then we started on our 2D Hollow Knight inspired platformer where you are a little wizard guy who must venture through a broken world to defeat something (we don't know what yet)</p>
        <p>FUN FACT TIME!!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We started making games on Roblox because it was easier</li>
            <li>We're a team of 3 people</li>
            <li>This is a third fact :O</li>
        </ul>
